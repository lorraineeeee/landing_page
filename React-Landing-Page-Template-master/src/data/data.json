  "About": {
    "paragraph": "The Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) Atlas represents MRI data sets, physiologic clinical data, and computational models from adults and children with various congenital heart defects. The data have been acquired from several clinical centers including Rady Children’s Hospital San Diego, UC San Diego Medical Center, and Starship Children’s Hospital in Auckland, New Zealand. The purpose of the study is to create a database of cardiac images and computational models in CHD patients that will enable clinicians and scientists to examine detailed ventricular shape and function in individual patients and compare them statistically against a database of similar CHD patient examinations. The computational models in this database allow for improved quantitative analysis of ventricular remodeling and changes in function to provide optimal management of CHD. The CHD Atlas database is part of the Cardiac Atlas Project (www.cardiacatlas.org), a worldwide project to establish a structural and functional atlas of the heart. Access to the database is subject to a Data Use Agreement between individual users and the owners (i.e. UCSD) of the data sets. Please contact PIs at the Cardiac Mechanics Research Group (cmrg.ucsd.edu) for information on DUAs with UCSD.",
